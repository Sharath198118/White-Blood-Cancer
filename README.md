# Detection of White Blood Cancer Using CNN

Leukocytes, which are formed in the bone marrow, account for about 1% of all blood cells. Blood cancer is caused by the uncontrolled growth of these white blood cells. Out of the three different types of cancers, the proposed work uses the SN-AM dataset to give a robust mechanism for the classification of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and Multiple Myeloma (MM). Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia(ALL) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow produces an excessive number of lymphocytes. On the other hand, Multiple myeloma (MM), a different kind of cancer, causes cancer cells to accumulate in the bone marrow rather than releasing them into the bloodstream. As a result, they suffocate and obstruct the generation of blood cells that are in good health. Conventionally, the process was carried out manually by a skilled professional in a considerable amount of time. Using deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks, the suggested model eliminates the possibility of errors in the human process. The model was trained on Images of cells are first pre-processed, and the best features are extracted. This is followed by training the model with the optimized Convolutional neural network framework and finally predicting the type of cancer present in the cells. As a result,the model can be used to accurately determine the type of cancer in the bone marrow.
